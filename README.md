# PennApps-XVII

    ______ is a classroom tool used by both professors and students to bring a more interactive and complete learning environment. 
This is a very simple, intuitive and user-friendly mobile and web tool that can be easily learned. Both the web and the mobile applications use the same login information from the student.

THE WEB APPLICATION
    The web application allows for the teacher to post their slides to be viewed by all the students in his/her class when they log in. Along with this, the web application also live transcribes the lecture for the students to view and take note from. Taking notes is also made easy as the students can take notes in the web app while having the transcript available also. The notes and transcripts can always be accessed by the student even if it has been a whole semester. Once the student is logged in, they can either access the previous powerpoint presentations, view the current slideshow and 
    
THE MOBILE APPLICATION
    The mobile application allows for increased interaction between the professor and students and allows them to get live feedback from the students. Feedback includes things such as: go faster, slow down, im confused, i understand (clear), speak up and speak lower. When the students press the button on their phone apps, the professor can see the feedback. also, students can ask professors questions during the lecture without having to feel scared since the questions provide anonymity from peers. I could ask the Professor why the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell if i felt like it in Bio class. Lastly, if the professor has an inclass question to ask his students, they can reply to the question on their phone. The professor will be able to see the answers each individual student put and also the statistics for each class. This can be used by the professor to alter their teaching methods or even assign participation grades to each student.
